            <p>Why is Google a successful company?
                Google's success originated in one simple insight from its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. 
                They realised in the late 1990s that the sprawling, 
                chaotic mass of material that was cascading onto the world wide web could be tamed by ranking 
                search results according to their popularity.
                Why do you want to work at Google?
                This is your chance to show that you understand the company and that you're the right fit.
                 Example: I love that Google is always creating new devices and apps. 
                 I've worked on a lot of apps in the past, and I think I would learn a lot in this position. 
                 I also think I could bring some new ideas to the team.</p>
